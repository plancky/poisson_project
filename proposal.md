## PROBLEM

Laplacian equation in one dimension - 
Potential between the capacitor plates, with a small distance of seperation, at steady state.

### PHYSICAL TO MATHEMATICAL
We have a capacitor with some positive potential $C$ Volts on plate A and potential -C Volts on plate B,
Distance between A and B is 1mm

Suppose plate A is at x=0mm and B is placed at x=1mm


$$
\frac{d^2 U(x)}{dx^2}   = 0
$$
$$
x \in [0,1]
$$
$$
U(0) = +C \hspace{1cm} U(1) = -C
$$
