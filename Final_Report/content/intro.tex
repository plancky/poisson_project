	\section {Introduction}
    \subsection{Motvation}
    \noindent 
    We first encountered Laplace Equation during our course in electricity and magnetism in second semester and we were fascinated with how one can calculatge the potential in a region just by knowing the boundary condition, ofcourse the region has to be charge free for applying Laplace Equation. After Laplace Equation , we were introduced to Poisson Equation which was able solve in region having charges( or sources ). When we were given the oppurtunity to choose a project in our computational physics charge this semester, it did not take us long to decide the topic for project.
    \subsection{General Idea}
    \noindent
    In our project we will try to tackle the Laplace and Poisson equaton which is an ellipitic linear partial differential equation having application in various fields of physics ranging from thermodynamics, electrostatics etc. We will solve the equation computationally using the method of finite differences in one and two dimensions for rectangular membrane
